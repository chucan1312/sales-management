# 📂 CPSC 210 Personal Project: Sales Management Application

A Java application that allows users to keep track of their store's sales and inventory. The program includes features to create, edit, and view lists of products and purchases, and all data is stored between sessions using a custom JSON persistence system built entirely with core Java (no external JSON libraries).

## ✨ Features

- **Inventory Management** – Add new products with details (name, ID, cost), update existing items, and search by ID or keywords.
- **Sales Recording** – Record purchases with date, sold items, and payment method; view purchase history by date range or filter by payment method.
- **Persistent Storage** – Save and load inventory and purchase records using a custom JSON persistence system built without external libraries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 8+   
- String operations for JSON encoding/decoding  
- JUnit (for testing, if applicable)
